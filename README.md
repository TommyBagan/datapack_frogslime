# Frogslime Datapack

Small whimsical improvements to frogs; to make them more fun and useful!

## Features

This datapack changes some basic elements of how Frogs work in minecraft:

- Frogs now drop sometimes slime balls on death, with potentially more dropped with a looting weapon.
- Frogs and tadpoles can be fed spider eyes (and fermented spider eyes) instead of slime balls.
- Frogs inflate when being fed a fermented spider eye, and when inflated drop more slime balls.
- Frogs can now also eat spiders, cave spiders, silverfish, bees and endermites.
- Be careful - super inflated frogs can pop!

## Roadmap

If there's enough interest, here are some potential future features:

- Some advancements!
- Players can use glass bottles on frogs, and receive a potion of oozing or jump boost. Inflated frogs give the drop potions of levitation or jump boost II potions.
- Cold frogs drop more slimeballs.
- Frogs can be crowned princes.
- Different colours of slime balls are dropped dependent on the variant.
