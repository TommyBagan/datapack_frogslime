# Frog Slime Datapack

Alters how frogs behave in Minecraft!

## Description

This datapack changes some basic elements of how Frogs work in minecraft:

- Frogs now drop sometimes slime balls on death, with potentially more dropped with a looting weapon.
- Frogs and tadpoles can be fed spider eyes (and fermented spider eyes) instead of slime balls.
- Frogs inflate when being fed a fermented spider eye, dropping more slime balls.
- Frogs can eat spiders.

## Roadmap

If there's enough interest, here are some potential future features:

- Different colours of slime balls are dropped dependent on the variant.

- Inspired by the [Tweaked Frogs Datapack](https://modrinth.com/datapack/tweaked-frogs), we could have frogs also eat silverfish and endermites. This would potentially make frogs teleport randomly after eating endermites, and do something else after eating silverfish.

If you have any ideas or encounter any bugs, feel free to raise an issue or PR on the GitHub page.
