# Frog Slime Datapack

Alters how frogs behave in Minecraft!

## Description

This datapack changes some basic elements of how Frogs work in minecraft:

- Frogs now drop sometimes slime balls on death, with potentially more dropped with a looting weapon.
- Frogs and tadpoles can be fed spider eyes (and fermented spider eyes) instead of slime balls.

## Roadmap

If there's enough interest, here are some potential future features:

- Frogs can eat spiders, and drop different things dependent on whether it was a cave spider or regular one.

- Different colours of slime balls are dropped dependent on the variant.

- Have frogs increase in size when being fed a fermented spider eye; potentially leading to them dropping more slime balls.

- Inspired by the [Tweaked Frogs Datapack](https://modrinth.com/datapack/tweaked-frogs), we could have frogs also eat silverfish and endermites. This would potentially make frogs teleport randomly after eating endermites, and do something else after eating silverfish.
